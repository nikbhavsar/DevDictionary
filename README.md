# Developer Social Network

## Welcome to the Developer Social Network! This is a full-stack application that brings developers together to collaborate, share experiences, and build connections within the developer community.
Key Features

    Secure Authentication: We've implemented a robust authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure the security of user data.

    Modern React: Our front end is built with React, making use of modern React Hooks for a smoother user experience.

    Efficient State Management: Redux is employed for managing the application's state, ensuring data consistency and reliability.

    Express Backend: The back-end is powered by Express, a fast and efficient Node.js web application framework. We use async/await for improved performance and enhanced data security.
